Note regarding data availability:

Due to copyright constraints from the newspaper database that we used (Factiva), we are unable to share
the set of newspaper articles that we have used for the analysis. We therefore opted to show the full 
reproduction in an RMarkdown file that shows the output of every step without disclosing copyrighted text. 
Furthermore, we added the ECB dataset as an .RData file that can be loaded into the regular .Rmd script for 
reproducing the results regarding the ECB communication. If one has access to the Factiva dataset, it is possible 
to reproduce our dataset with the newspaper identifiers provided in the newspaper_identifiers.csv dataset. Unfortunately, 
the Factiva newspaper ID does not create unique ids, therefore a combination of identifiers is necessary to download
the right articles.
